# Code Challenge: Loop-d-loop

The purpose of this assignment it to get you used to creating and tinkering with JavaScript code. 

Assignment: Using VS Code, create a project, zip it, and submit it. 

**Directions:**

1. Create a new VS Code project called LAST_NAME_LoopDLoop. 
2. Create the following using what you learned and submit. 

**MVP Story:**

A local fitness coach and mechanical engineer is building an IoT device that pops out a piece of candy every time a runner reaches 2 miles on a treadmill but stops giving candy out at mile 6. We're tasked with building the loop functionality to know when to give a piece of candy and when to stop.

Step 1: Using comments in your VS Code, answer the following questions: 

- How do we know we need a loop here? 
- What's the starting point of the loop?
- When should the loop stop?
- How will it know to stop?
- What's the incrementing for each iteration of the loop?
- What variables do we need?

NOTE --> the above list of questions is a great tool to help you break down building a loop. Moving forward, you will be expected to know to ask those questions on your own. 

Step 2: Build out the loop.

Step 3: Save and submit.

Create a new loop where the runner only gets a piece of candy at every 2 miles AND if they were going move than 5.5 miles per hour.
