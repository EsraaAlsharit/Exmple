# Hello Human

You are tasked to build a page that will greet whoever visits your page. If they don't tell you their name, then greet them as "human".

### Objectives:

- Use url strings to pass query parameter values to the server
- Use data passed to the server through request parameters in a response to the client.

### Assignment

Create an app that will show in the browser either a default value of "human" or the name provided in the URL query string. Please note, you may show simple text without any html formatting.
