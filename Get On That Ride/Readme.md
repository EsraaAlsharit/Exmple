# Code Challenge: Get On That Ride

The purpose of this assignment it to get you used to creating and tinkering with JavaScript code.

**Assignment:** Using VS Code, create a project, zip it, and submit it.

**Directions:**

1. Open your Create Variables project.
2. Create the following using what you learned about conditionals, variables and data types, and submit the assignment.

The Story: We want an app that once it measures a kid's height, can display whether the child is tall enough to ride the rollercoaster. We're tasked with building the function that will display the right message to the child.

*Step 1: Review and edit your variables as needed*

- Are your variables accurate? Update them if need be.

*Step 2: Create a conditional where:*

- If the rider's height is greater than 52, the console.log should say "Get on that ride, kiddo!". Otherwise, console.log should say "Sorry kiddo. Maybe next year."

TIP: If you get stuck, that's ok! Keep tinkering with it. Use the pages in this course to help you out.

**Stretch Feature 1**

Adjust the conditional statement to require both height and age.

**Stretch Feature 2**

Adjust the conditional statement to require either height requirement or age requirement must be met.

**NOTE:** Google is your friend here for Stretch 2. See what you can tinker and build.
