# Organizing Files

### Objectives:
- Set up a folder structure to keep our Python files organized
<hr>

Throughout this month, we are going to be creating a lot of projects! To stay organized, let's set up a folder structure where we can keep all of the assignments we'll be doing during this Python track. Tip: Don't give your files or folders names with spaces in them! We recommend having a folder structure like this, that follows along with the chapters throughout the track:

- python_stack
- |-- my_environments
- |-- _python (the underscore IS IMPORTANT)
    - |-- python_fundamentals
    - |-- OOP
- |-- django
    - |-- django_fundamentals
    - |-- django_orm
    - |-- django_fullstack


- [x] Create a folder structure for Python assignments and projects
