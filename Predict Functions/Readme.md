# Code Challenge: Predict Functions

**Assignment:** Practice what you've learned to predict the following. 

Directions

- Open a new VS Code file.
- Save it as a .js type and name it LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_JSPredict
- Using comments (use two forward slashes --> //), Answer the predict questions. 
- Zip and upload the file.

**Predict 1:** What will console.log state when this function is called?

```md
function myBirthYearFunc(){
    console.log("I was born in" + 1980);
}
````

**Predict 2:** If we needed to send a birth year to the function, we would tell the function "hey, we're gonna send you a variable called birthYearInput." We do that by adding the variable name into the parentheses. See below for an example. 

So, if the variable birthYearInput is 1980 (aka var birthYearInput = 1980), and this function is called, what would the console.log state?

```md
function myBirthYearFunc(birthYearInput){
    console.log("I was born in" + birthYearInput);
}
````

**Predict 3:** Let's try it again. If var num1 = 10 and var num2 = 20, what would the console.log state?

```md
function add(num1, num2){
    console.log("Summing Numbers!");
    console.log("num1 is: " + num1);
    console.log("num2 is: " + num2);
    var sum = num1 + num2;
    console.log(sum);
}
````

NOTE: Not every code challenge will come with a solution. Sometimes it's not about getting it right, it's about doing the practice. Again, this is like training for a marathon: sometimes the mile you run on Tuesday sucks, but at least you got a run in.
