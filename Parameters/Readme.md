# Code Challenge: Parameters

Using what you've learned about functions and parameters, create a function that, given a name, will say "good day" to that person by name.

For example, the function call `greet("Anakin")` would log to the console, `Good day, Anakin!`

**Level 2:** Further customize your function by including the time of day in your greeting. Hint: can functions only take one parameter?
