# Code Challenge: Predict Arrays and Conditionals

Assignment: Create T-diagrams to predict the output for the following code snippets.

**Directions:**

1. For each code snippet, create a T-diagram.
2. Create a single text document or photograph of your T-Diagrams that contains the 10 T-diagrams for the code snippets below and submit it.

**Reminder:** This is an opportunity for you to build the habit of showing up for yourself. We won't be reviewing your work, AND your brain needs this workout. Remember, practice a skill regardless of whether a coach or teacher or boss or peer will look at it. This isn't school. This is a dojo.

### Code Snippet 1

```md
function displayContactInfo() {
    var auntContactInfo = ["Paula", "Smith", "1234 Main Street", "St. Louis", "MO", 12345];
    console.log(auntContactInfo);
}
````

### Code Snippet 2

```md
function displayGrocerylist() {
    var produce = ["apples", "oranges"];
    var frozen = ["broccoli", "ice cream"];
    frozen.push("hashbrowns");
    console.log(frozen);
}
````

### Code Snippet 3

```md
var movieLibrary = ["Bambi", "E.T.", "Toy Story"];
movieLibrary.push("Zoro");
movieLibrary[1] = "Beetlejuice";
console.log(movieLibrary);
````
