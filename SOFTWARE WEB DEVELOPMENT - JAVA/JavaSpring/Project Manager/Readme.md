# Project Manager Extra Belt Review

### Objectives:

- Prepare you for black belt features you may see on an exam.
- Build many-to-many relationships into a full-featured application, to prepare for project week.

Note: The ninja bonuses are features that you would see as Black Belt features. Indeed some functionality on the dashboard would also likely be a black belt feature. This assignment is more difficult than a belt exam, so if you complete this assignment you should be able to earn a black belt.
